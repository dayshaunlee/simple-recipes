# Simple Recipes
A Python script so you don't have to read an article every time you want to cook.

## Overview
The goal of this program is to provide a simple and clean way to view online recipes, by bypassing the clutter on a typical recipe website. Benefits include ignoring the following:
- that super long article before the recipe
- the pop-up asking to accept cookies every time
- annoying ads
- that video in the corner that takes up a quarter of the page

What's left is just the ingredients and the steps; nothing more.
